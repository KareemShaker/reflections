How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it shows the old version and the new version differences in lines. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    it makes you as a developer on control of your work. You can go back to
	any point at any time to change. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   pros are that you choose the logical change to commit. 
   cons are you might commit too small or two big.
   having versions automatically saved is not the best idea as it will 
   crumble the history of changes with no need.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is treating the files as related to each other if they are in one rapository. 
	this will makes you keep track of changes in related files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log is to view all the commits in the repository
	git diff is to compare between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    because i know that i can go back to the point has the problem at any time

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I would like to start using git in all of my work
