When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository is usefull to be accessed from anywhere. Also, people can interact and work with you through it.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: this will give me control on when I should update my local repository.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: Forks are done on the github to clone or copy a repository. While clones are done localy or to clone a repository
from github to local one. Brances are done inside one repository. 

Q:What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A: to avoid conflicts with other collaborators work

Q:How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A: By a lot of emails exchange and sharing pool of files. It would be harder if the there are 
many people involved and a lot of work to be shared. it would be easier if only two or max 3 persons.

Q: When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?
A: I would make changes on other branches when I am not sure if this change will break the master
and also if i want to check with another developer before commiting.
working on master is much easier if number of people work are small. But if the number of people
is big and the work done is alot so branches is the best approach.
